Bug Report:

*somehow the player gets stucked in the last line (it can't go up, only walks
left and right. It also appears in the top line if I click down)

*when player collides with an asteroid, he goes to the block right of the asteroid

* if player grab one wrong answer, the port will never show up even all correct
answers have been grabed.

[fixed]* if you use the force field and kill the enemy, you are gonna die if go
to the last cell in the right-hand side of the line you killed the enemy.

[fixed]*you can kill the enemy even if he is in the line above you (e.g.: E:Enemy,
  P:Player, laser: ----)
